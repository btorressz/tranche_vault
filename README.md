# üè¶ Tranche Vault - Solana Program

A Solana smart contract implementing a two-tranche vault system with Senior and Junior tranches, featuring yield distribution with Senior APY caps and loss waterfalls.

___

## üìñ Overview

This program creates a structured finance vault with two distinct tranches:

üü¶ Senior Tranche: Lower risk, capped returns

üü• Junior Tranche: Higher risk, receives residual yield and absorbs losses first

The vault uses fixed-point arithmetic (1e9 scale) for USD-denominated accounting and operates on a share-based system (like vault tokens).

___

## ‚ú® Key Features
**1Ô∏è‚É£ Two-Tranche Structure**

- Senior Tranche: Protected position with yield capped at a configurable APY

- Junior Tranche: Absorbs first losses, receives all remaining yield above the Senior cap

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Yield Distribution (Waterfall)**
- Total Yield ‚Üí Senior (up to cap) ‚Üí Junior (remainder)


- Senior receives the minimum of (yield, cap_amount)

- Junior receives the residual above the cap

- Cap is calculated per period as:
- senior_nav * senior_apy_cap_bps / 10,000

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Loss Distribution (Reverse Waterfall)**
- Total Loss ‚Üí Junior (first) ‚Üí Senior (only if Junior depleted)


- Junior absorbs losses up to its NAV

- Senior takes losses only if Junior NAV = 0

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Share-Based Accounting**

- Each tranche issues shares based on Price Per Share (PPS)

- PPS = NAV / shares_supply

- Initial PPS = 1.0 (in fixed-point: 1e9)

## üõ†Ô∏è Program Instructions

### `initialize_vault`

Creates a new vault.

**Parameters:**
- `authority`: Vault manager's pubkey  
- `senior_apy_cap_bps`: Senior APY cap in basis points (e.g., `1000 = 10%`)

---

### `deposit_senior`

Deposit funds into the **Senior** tranche.

**Parameters:**
- `amount_usd_fp`: USD amount in fixed-point (1e9 scale)

**Behavior:**
- Mints shares based on current Senior PPS  
- Updates NAV and total shares  
- Tracks user position via PDA

---

### `deposit_junior`

Deposit funds into the **Junior** tranche.

**Parameters:**
- `amount_usd_fp`: USD amount in fixed-point

**Behavior:**
- Same logic as Senior deposit  
- Junior PPS is calculated independently

---

### `distribute_yield`

Distributes positive yield across both tranches.

**Parameters:**
- `yield_fp`: Total yield in fixed-point

**Behavior:**
- Calculates Senior yield cap  
- Allocates yield using waterfall logic  
- Emits `YieldDistributed` event

---

### `simulate_loss` *(Authority only)*

Simulates portfolio losses for testing or stress analysis.

**Parameters:**
- `total_loss_fp`: Loss amount in fixed-point

**Behavior:**
- Junior absorbs first  
- Senior absorbs remainder if Junior depleted  
- Updates NAVs accordingly

---

### `simulate_yield_surplus` *(Authority only)*

Simulates yield generation for testing and dry runs.

**Parameters:**
- `amount_usd_fp`: Simulated yield in fixed-point

**Behavior:**
- Follows same logic as `distribute_yield`  
- Emits `SimulatedYield` event

---

## üß† Account Structures

### `TrancheVault` (143 bytes)

Main state account for the vault.

- `authority: Pubkey` ‚Äî Vault manager
- `senior_total_deposits: u128`
- `junior_total_deposits: u128`
- `senior_shares_supply: u128`
- `junior_shares_supply: u128`
- `senior_nav: u128`
- `junior_nav: u128`
- `senior_apy_cap_bps: u16`
- `last_yield_ts: i64`
- `bump: u8`

---

### `UserPosition` (64 bytes)

User-specific account storing position data.

- `owner: Pubkey` ‚Äî User wallet
- `senior_shares: u128`
- `junior_shares: u128`

---

## üíµ Fixed-Point Math

All USD values use 9-decimal fixed-point representation.

- `FP_SCALE = 1_000_000_000`  
  Example: $100.00 = `100_000_000_000`

APY caps use **basis points (BPS)** for percentage values.

- `BPS_DENOM = 10_000`  
  Example: `1000` = 10% APY cap

---

## üì¢ Events

- **Deposited**: User deposit occurred  
- **YieldDistributed**: Yield allocation breakdown  
- **LossApplied**: Loss distribution across tranches  
- **SimulatedYield**: Simulated yield event  
- **SimulatedLoss**: Simulated loss event  

---

## ‚ùó Error Codes

- **InvalidAmount**: Zero or invalid input  
- **Unauthorized**: Caller not vault authority  
- **MathOverflow**: Arithmetic overflow  
- **ZeroShares**: Would mint 0 shares (dust input)  
- **CapExceeded**: Exceeds Senior yield cap  

---

## üîê Security Features

- ‚úÖ Safe arithmetic (no unchecked overflows)  
- ‚úÖ PDA-based account derivation  
- ‚úÖ Admin functions gated by authority pubkey  
- ‚úÖ Position updates require owner signature  
- ‚úÖ Protection against zero-value actions
